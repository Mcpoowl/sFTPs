# (S)FTPS module for Mendix

Welcome to the (S)FTP module.
This module uses the Jsch and Apache commons library to allow connections to (S)FTP servers.

This module is an updated version of already existing versions in the Mendix AppStore. Due to the fact that other versions are no longer updated and maintained, we've uploaded this version.


# Dependencies
* Jsch
* Apache Commons

# Installation

Download the module in your project. Add the Connection detail pages to your application, and start using the FTP actions in your microflows.

# Features:

* FTP
* SFTP
* FTPS
* Browse / Upload / Download / Zip / Delete 

# Notes

As stated above, this module is an updated version of old AppStore content, made ready for Mendix 7 with some improvements. That doesn't mean everything has been refactored (yet). So if you run in to any trouble, errors or if you want extra features, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/McPoowl/sFTPs/). You could also create a pull request ofcourse :-)
